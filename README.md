# Cereal Engine

A small 2D top-down shooter engine written in plain JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas, running in [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). It's built to keep **as many enemies, bullets and particles on screen as possible**, and to make arena shooters quick to put together.

The engine ships with **Windows Defender**, a meme-themed arena shooter: survive waves of enemies pouring in from the screen edges, using an inventory of ridiculous guns, a dash, powerups and allied turrets.

## Features

- **Entities**: player, enemies, bullets, turrets, powerups and explosions, with sprite rotation, flipping and drop shadows.
- **Fast collision**: a spatial grid per entity type, rebuilt every frame, so each entity only checks its neighbours.
- **Weapons**: a slot-based inventory of guns with their own projectile count, speed, spread, damage, fire rate, hit sound and optional explosive rounds.
- **Particles**: a capped particle system for blood, hitmarkers, explosions and effects.
- **Enemy spawners**: timed spawners whose interval can shrink over time to ramp up difficulty.
- **Turret AI**: allied turrets aim with intercept prediction, calculated in a Web Worker.
- **Global time scale**: slow motion that affects movement, timers, spawners and GIF playback together.
- **Screen effects**: camera shake and zoom, and CSS filter effects (saturation, grayscale, contrast and more).
- **Responsive display**: the game fits any window size, showing extra world on wider or taller windows instead of stretching. Optional nearest-neighbour rendering for pixel art.
- **Automatic asset loading**: drop an image or sound into the assets folder and it becomes a global you can use.
- **Level base class**: a `Level` class handles the camera, managers, spawners, death, pause, controls and cleanup, so a level only describes what's in it.
- **Optional extras**: A\* pathfinding (easystar.js) and gamepad support are built in but not enabled by default.

## Getting started

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WillAngus/cereal-engine
cd cereal-engine
npm install
npm start
```

`npm start` runs `electron . --no-sandbox`. The `--no-sandbox` flag is needed on Linux, where Electron's `chrome-sandbox` helper isn't set up as root.

To check the game boots without errors and see its console output in the terminal:

```bash
timeout 20 ./node_modules/.bin/electron . --no-sandbox --enable-logging=stderr 2>&1 | grep -i console
```

## Controls

### Gameplay

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| W A S D | Move |
| Mouse | Aim |
| Left click | Shoot |
| Space | Dash |
| 1 – 4 | Switch weapon |
| I | Spawn an allied turret |
| Y | Trippy mode |
| U | Spooky mode |
| Esc | Pause |

On the death screen, **R** or **Esc** restarts the level.

### Gamepad

The d-pad moves, the top shoulder buttons switch weapons, the bottom-left shoulder dashes and Start pauses. Analog stick movement is currently broken.

### Developer keys

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| R | Reload the window |
| Q | Restart the current state |
| O | Print the sprite size report |

## Windows Defender

The included game, set up in `game/states/levels/WindowsDefender.js`.

- **Weapons**: chicken, dorito, banana and Dew guns. The Dew gun fires explosive rounds and plays music while equipped.
- **Dash**: launches the player with an emoji explosion, then a damaging explosion where the dash ends. It recharges over time.
- **Enemies**: Snoop/Steve grunts, a bigger and faster variant, and explosive Creepers whose death explosion damages other enemies. Spawns speed up over time.
- **Boss**: an "Alert" boss with 1000 HP arrives every ~500 ticks and changes sprite as it takes damage.
- **Powerups**: enemies sometimes drop a temporary weapon, +50 max health, or a joint that triggers trippy mode.
- **Trippy mode**: quarter speed, a wormhole background, boosted saturation and screen shake.
- **Spooky mode**: grayscale and high contrast, and enemies are replaced by tougher skulls.
- **Anti-camping**: stand still for too long and the screen starts shaking.

The repo also includes `Reskin.js`, a pixel art variant of the arena with staff and bow weapons, and `LevelTemplate.js`, a minimal level to copy.

## How it works

### No modules

There's no bundler and no `import`/`export`. Scripts are loaded in order by `<script>` tags in `index.html`, and classes, sprites, sounds and managers are all globals. **When you add a file, add a script tag for it in `index.html`**, after anything it uses when it loads. Levels go after `Level.js`.

The renderer has full Node access (`nodeIntegration`), which the asset loaders use to read the asset folders with `fs`.

### Boot and game loop

1. Electron opens a frameless window with an HTML title bar (`main.js`).
2. The asset loaders turn every image and sound into a global while the Pace loading bar runs.
3. When loading finishes, oversized sprites are prescaled, then `Game.init()` sets up the canvas and starts the first level with `Game.startGame()`.
4. `Game.run()` runs every frame with `requestAnimationFrame`. It computes `deltaTime` (1.0 at 60fps), then updates and draws the current state.

### States

The game is a stack of states (`setup.js`). Each state has `onEnter`, `onExit`, `onPause`, `onResume`, `update` and `display`.

Always change state through the `Game` object:

- `Game.setState(new SomeLevel())` leaves the current state and enters a new one.
- `Game.restartState()` leaves and re-enters the current state.

Both go through `Game.exitState()`, which runs the state's `onExit` and then resets everything shared: it clears timers, unbinds the state's keys, releases held input, unpauses, resets CSS filters, stops audio and resets screen shake and game speed. A state only needs to clean up what it created itself.

### Entities and collision

```
Entity
├── Creature   (health, movement, smoothed rotation)
│   ├── Player
│   ├── Enemy
│   └── Turret
├── Bullet
├── Powerup
└── Explosion
```

Each entity has an `entityType` string (`'player'`, `'enemy'`, `'bullet'`, `'turret'`, `'powerup'`, `'explosion'`). The `EntityManager` keeps one spatial grid per type, rebuilt every frame with 64px cells. `entity.handleCollision(exclude, callback)` only checks nearby entities of other types, so enemies never search through other enemies.

Removed entities are flagged `removed = true` so they can't be hit again in the same frame. Arrays returned by collision queries are reused, so don't keep them.

Particles aren't entities. They're owned by the `ParticleSystem`.

### Rendering

- Each level draws inside a `Camera`, which handles screen shake and zoom.
- `Game.resize()` fits a 1280×720 area into the window and backs the canvas at full screen resolution. With `settings.responsive`, the world grows on the spare axis instead of letterboxing.
- **Always use the globals `width` and `height` for world-space layout**, never 1280/720 or the window size.
- Drop shadows are generated on the GPU on first use and toggled with `settings.shadowsEnabled`.
- Visual effects are CSS filters on the canvas, set with `Game.setFilter('--saturate', 1.5)` and reset with `Game.resetFilters()`.
- The pause menu and title bar are HTML styled with [XP.css](https://botoxparty.github.io/XP.css/).

## Making a level

Extend `Level` and override only what you need. The quickest start is to copy `game/states/levels/LevelTemplate.js`.

```js
class MyLevel extends Level {
	constructor() {
		super('my_level');
		// Image shown behind the canvas
		this.background = bg_windows_bliss;
		// Spawners get 0.01 ticks faster every frame, down to 10
		this.spawnRamp = 0.01;
	}

	setup() {
		this.addBackground('bliss', [bg_windows_bliss]);

		this.spawnPlayer(spr_player_gates, width / 2, height - 64, 64, 64, 100, 7, (parent) => [
			new Gun('chicken_gun', spr_chicken_gun, p_chicken, parent, 24, 16, 1, 20, 1, 15, audio.mp3_hitmarker, p_hitmarker, false)
		]);

		this.addSpawner(55, () => {
			let p = this.edgePoint('top');
			entityManager.spawnEntity(new Enemy('enemy' + entityManager.entities.length, spr_steve,
				p.x, p.y, 65, 65, player, 10, 2, 0.875, false, audio.mp3_hitmarker, 1));
		});
	}

	drawHud() {
		Game.c.font = '50px Comic Sans MS';
		Game.c.fillStyle = '#fff';
		Game.c.fillText('score: ' + this.score, 10, 50);
	}
}
```

Then add `<script type="text/javascript" src="./game/states/levels/MyLevel.js"></script>` to `index.html` after `Level.js`, and start it with `Game.setState(new MyLevel())`, or from `Game.startGame()` in `Game.js` to make it the first level.

### Hooks

| Hook | When it runs |
|---|---|
| `setup()` | On entering the level. Spawn the player, backgrounds and spawners here. |
| `tick()` | Every unpaused frame, for level-specific logic. |
| `drawWorld()` | After entities and particles, in world space (moves with the camera). |
| `drawHud()` | Last, in screen space, on top of everything. |
| `cleanup()` | On leaving the level. Free anything `setup()` created, like a Web Worker. |
| `dropPowerup(enemy)` | When an enemy dies and rolls a drop (`settings.powerupDropRate`). |
| `dashEvent()` | When the player dashes. |

### Options

Set these in the constructor after `super()`.

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `background` | `null` | Image shown behind the canvas |
| `cursor` | `cur_pixel` | Image drawn at the mouse position, `null` for none |
| `hideCursor` | `true` | Hide the system cursor |
| `maxEntities` | `5000` | Entity limit |
| `maxParticles` | `1000` | Particle limit |
| `maxBackgrounds` | `10` | Background screen limit |
| `spawnRamp` | `0` | Ticks taken off every spawner's interval each frame |
| `minSpawnTime` | `10` | Shortest spawner interval |
| `deathScreen` | `DeathScreen01` | State to show when the player dies, `null` to restart straight away |

### Helpers

| Helper | What it does |
|---|---|
| `spawnPlayer(sprite, x, y, width, height, health, speed, makeWeapons)` | Spawns the player, sets the global `player` and gives it an inventory. `makeWeapons(parent)` returns its guns. |
| `addBackground(id, images, alpha, gifs)` | Adds a background screen. The first one added is shown. |
| `addSpawner(spawnTime, callback)` | Adds a spawner that calls `callback` every `spawnTime` ticks. |
| `edgePoint(edge, margin)` | A random point just off the `'top'`, `'bottom'`, `'left'` or `'right'` edge. The returned Vector is reused. |
| `Game.bind(key, fn, event)` | Binds a key until the level is left. |

`Level` already binds movement, dash, weapon slots 1–5 and pause. Levels track their score in `this.score`, which enemies add to when they die.

## Assets

### Images

Every file in `game/assets/img/` (including subfolders) becomes a global named after the file, so `slayer/spr_snoop.png` becomes `spr_snoop`. `.gif` files load as animated GIFs. A file whose name isn't a valid JavaScript identifier, or would overwrite an existing global, is refused with a console error.

Use these prefixes:

| Prefix | Use |
|---|---|
| `spr_` | Sprites |
| `p_` | Particles and bullets |
| `bg_` | Backgrounds |
| `gif_` | Animations |
| `cur_` | Cursors |

At startup, `spr_` and `p_` images larger than their limit in `spriteMaxSize` (in `LoadAssets.js`) are shrunk to save memory and drawing time.

### Sounds

Files in `game/assets/sound/sfx/` load into `audio.<name>`, and files in `game/assets/sound/music/` into `music.<name>`, named after the file. Per-sound volumes go in the `soundVolumes` table in `Sound.js`.

```js
audio.mp3_hitmarker.play();
music.mp3_skrillex.play(0, 0, true);
music.mp3_skrillex.stop();
```

## Engine reference

### Constructors

| Class | Signature |
|---|---|
| `Player` | `Player(id, sprite, x, y, width, height, health, speed)` |
| `Enemy` | `Enemy(id, sprite, x, y, width, height, target, health, speed, friction, showHealthBar, deathSound, scoreValue)` |
| `Turret` | `Turret(id, sprite, targetType, x, y, width, height, health, speed, ammo)` |
| `Gun` | `Gun(id, sprite, bulletSprite, parent, bulletWidth, bulletHeight, amount, speed, dither, damage, hitSound, hitParticle, equipped)` |
| `Inventory` | `Inventory(max, contents)` |
| `Powerup` | `Powerup(id, sprite, x, y, width, height, onCollision)`. Return `true` from `onCollision` to consume it. |
| `Explosion` | `Explosion(x, y, particleWidth, particleHeight, amount, range, dither, damage, p1, p2, p3)` |
| `Particle` | `Particle(id, sprite, x, y, width, height, velocity, direction, health, dither)` |
| `EnemySpawner` | `EnemySpawner(max, spawnTime, spawnTimer, active, amount, callback)` |

### Useful properties

- **`Gun`**: `firerate`, `explosive` (bullets explode on hit), `p1`/`p2`/`p3` (explosion particles), `onEquip()`/`onHolster()`.
- **`Enemy`**: `enableRotation`, `faceTarget` (flip to face the target), `explosive` (explodes on death), `hitmarker`, `knockBack`, `hitbox`, and `sprite_dmg_enabled` with `sprite_dmg_1`/`sprite_dmg_2` (change sprite at 66% and 33% health).

### Globals

| Global | What it is |
|---|---|
| `Game` | The game object: canvas (`Game.canvas`, `Game.c`), states, key binding, filters |
| `player` | The current player |
| `entityManager` | `spawnEntity(e)`, `getEntityById(id)`, `removeEntity(e)`, `entities` |
| `particleSystem` | `spawnParticle(p)`, `particles` |
| `backgroundManager` | `selectBackgroundScreen(id)`, `screens` |
| `timerManager` | `addTimer(callback, delay)`. Timers pause with the game and are cleared when the level is left. |
| `width`, `height` | The current world size |
| `deltaTime` | Frame time, where 1.0 is one frame at 60fps |
| `settings` | Runtime settings (below) |

### Settings

Runtime settings live in the `settings` object at the top of `game/Game.js`.

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `responsive` | `true` | Show extra world on wider or taller windows instead of letterboxing |
| `pixelated` | `false` | Nearest-neighbour scaling for pixel art |
| `particlesEnabled` | `true` | Draw particles |
| `shadowsEnabled` | `true` | Draw entity shadows |
| `shadowDistance` | `3` | Shadow offset |
| `speed` | `1` | Time scale. Lower is slow motion. |
| `shake` | `0` | Current screen shake amount |
| `powerupDropRate` | `5` | Percent chance an enemy drops a powerup |
| `pathfindingEnabled` | `true` | A\* pathfinding (levels built on `Level` turn it off) |
| `tileSize` | `64` | Pathfinding grid size |
| `logSpriteSizes` | `true` | Record the largest size each sprite is drawn at (press O for the report) |

`scale`, `paused`, `maximized`, `gamepadConnected` and `lastInput` are set by the engine.

## Performance

Performance matters in every change, since the goal is the largest possible number of entities on screen.

- Avoid allocating objects every frame in hot paths (entity and particle loops, collision). Reuse arrays and objects.
- Measure changes with real numbers, using a benchmark or an in-game timing, rather than guessing.

Planned improvements, roughly in order: object pools for bullets and particles, `setTransform` instead of `save`/`restore` per entity, a static background layer, a single shadow pass, a stress-test key, and eventually a WebGL renderer.

## Known issues

Bugs:

- Gamepad analog movement throws an error. `Player.update` calls `moveTo` without `this`, and passes Vectors where angles are expected.
- `Creature.setSize` crashes on anything other than the player, because it resizes a dash bar only the player has.
- Entity ids are built from the entity count (`'enemy' + entities.length`), so they aren't unique after removals. `getEntityById` and the turret aiming lookup can match the wrong entity.
- The `Enemy` constructor ignores its `showHealthBar` argument and always sets it to `false`, so enemy health bars never show.
- `Bullet.js` checks `this.rotation == NaN`, which is always false. It should use `isNaN`.

Cleanup:

- The audio slider's `onclick` is assigned twice in `Game.js`, so the first assignment never runs.
- `BackgroundScreen` stores the return value of `timerManager.addTimer`, which is always `undefined`.
- `PowerupScripts.js` isn't valid JavaScript, and `AudioAnalyser.js` is unused. Neither is loaded.
- `darkenImage` and `contrastImage` in `Maths.js` are unused.
